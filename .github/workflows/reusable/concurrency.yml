# Reusable YAML anchor for concurrency across workflows
# Usage in a workflow: add the following near the top-level (same level as `on`):
#   <<: *default_concurrency
# Or if YAML anchors arenâ€™t supported due to Actions parsing nuances, copy the block.

x-defaults: &default_concurrency
  concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true
